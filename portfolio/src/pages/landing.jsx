            <p>
              I'm Rohit Sawant, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with
              expertise in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
              I thrive on turning creative ideas into high-quality, scalable web
              applications.
              <br />I embarked on my web development journey with a strong
              foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I delved deeper into
              the world of coding, I discovered the power and versatility of the
              MERN stack. My curiosity led me to explore each layer of the
              stack, and I quickly found my sweet spot in crafting seamless,
              interactive user experiences.
